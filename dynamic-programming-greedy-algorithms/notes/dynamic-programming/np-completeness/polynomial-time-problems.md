# Polynomial Time Problems

Problems that can be solved in polynomial time relative to their input size by a computer are considered "fast." (O(n^c) time for some constant c)

Those that run in exponential time are considered "slow."

## NP: Nondeterministic Polynomial Time

Algorithms that can be verified in polynomial time given an answer/extra information, but cannot be solved in polynomial time (the "yes" answer has a certificate).
