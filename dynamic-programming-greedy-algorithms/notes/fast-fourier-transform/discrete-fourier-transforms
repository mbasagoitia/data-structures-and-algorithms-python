# Discrete Fourier Transforms

Recall that complex roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^n = 1. Each root has modulus 1 and forms an angle of 2pi/n on the complex plane. 1 is always a root of unity.

A complex number can be written in exponential form as **z = re^(j * theta)** where r = modulus, theta = angle and j = the square root of -1.

## Nth Roots of Unity

The roots of unity are generated by a single generator, wn.

wn = cos (2pi/n) + sin (2pi/n)j

This is equal to **e^((2pi/n)j)**. This (wn) is the complex number that makes an angle of 2pi/n with the real axis.

All of the n roots of unity are wn^0, wn^1, wn^2 ... wn^k-1, generated as power of the generator root wn. The 0th power of the generator is 1.

The kth root of unity is e^((2pi/n)k * j)

wn^n = 1

e^(pi*j) = -1

## Discrete Fourier Transform

If we consider a signal to be a list of values [a0, a1 .... an-1] of n real numbers and assume that this sequence is periodic (repeats beyond time n-1), we can interpret a Fourier series from the polynomial that this sequence gives us.

a(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x^2 .... an-1x^n-1

For example, [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1] = the polynomial a(x) = 1 - x + x^2- x^3 + x^4 - x^5 where we need to determine x.

Fourier Transform: Evaluate this polynomial for various roots of unity.

a(wn^0), a(wn^1), .... a(wn^n-1) <- evaluating all of these will give you complex numbers [A1, A2 ... An-1]. We consider this the DFT of the sequence.

Example: [1, -1, 1, -1] DFT -> [0, 0, 4, 0]

## Recap of DFT

Given a sequence of [a0, a1, a2, ... an-1], define the polynomial a(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x^2 .... an-1x^n-1. The DFT of this sequence is [A0, A1, A2 .... An-1] where Ak = a(wn^k) which is a polynomial evaluated at the kth root of unity, a0 + a1wn^k + a2wnk^2 ... an-1wn^k^n-1.

**Evaluate the polynomial a(x) on each root of unity.**

## Inverse DFT

Given a sequence [A0 ... An-1], there is a symmetric process of inverting (Inverse Fourier Transform) which gives you the original sequence.

A(z) = 1/n * [A0z^0 + A1z^1 ... + Anz^n]

ai (the ith coefficient) = A(conjugate(wn)^i)

## Interpretation

Each Fourier coefficient is associated with a vector that rotates at a specific frequency. ai can be written as a combination of these coefficients * these vectors.

Naively, calculating either the DFT or Inverse DFT takes n^2 time. In the next lecture, we will find out how to do it in n log n time with divide and conquer.
