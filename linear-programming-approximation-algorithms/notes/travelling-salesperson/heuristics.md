# Heuristics for TSP

Algorithms for "solving" TSPs that provide no guarantees on the quality of the solution.

## Kernighan-Lin Heuristic

- Local search algorithm:

Find a randomized TSP tour of all vertices and perform exchanges of edges such that you get a better solution; repeat with a different starting point and return the least cost tour.

Effective as long as exchanges are fast.
