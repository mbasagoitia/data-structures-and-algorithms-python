# Binary search

## Searching algorithm with O log(n) time complexity

1. Calculate middle element and initialize left and right pointers
2. Compare x with middle element
3. If x matches middle element, return it
4. If x is greater than the middle element, ignore the left half of the array and search the right half and vice versa
5. Apply algorithm again for right half (or left half) if x is smaller

Iterative and a recursive solution

The array must be sorted to perform binary search
