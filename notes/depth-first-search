# Depth-First Search

## Depthâ€“first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. Starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root for a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- Preorder: visit each node before its children.
- Postorder: visit each node after its children.
- Inorder (for binary trees only): visit left subtree, node, right subtree.

Implementation involves using a stack (LIFO)
