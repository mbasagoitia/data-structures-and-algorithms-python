# Heaps

## A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

- A heap is essentially a special binary tree represented by an array of numbers called keys with some "special" properties

## Heap Properties

- Every node has at most two children
- If a node has a right child, it MUST also have a left child (a property not present in binary trees)
- For every element i in a heap, its left child is represented by 2i (where 2i <= n, the length of the array) and its right child is represented by 2i + 1 (where 2i + 1 <=n)
- For every element j in in a heap, its parent is represented by j // 2 (half the index of j rounded down)
- The first element in a heap has no parent and is called the root

- Max-Heap: In a max-heap, for any given node i, the value of i is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This means the maximum value is at the root of the heap.
- Min-Heap: In a min-heap, for any given node i, the value of i is less than or equal to the values of its children. This means the minimum value is at the root of the heap.

Heaps are typically implemented as binary heaps, where each node has at most two children.

- A heap is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels of the tree are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.

## Heap operations

- Insertion: 
    - Add the element at the end of the tree (maintain the complete binary tree property).
    - Restore the heap property by "bubbling up" the element (swap it with its parent until the heap property is restored).

- Deletion (Extracting Max/Min):
    - To remove the root of the heap (the maximum in a max-heap or minimum in a min-heap):
    - Replace the root with the last element in the tree.
    - Remove the last element (as it has been moved to the root).
    - Restore the heap property by "bubbling down" the root element (swap it with its largest child in a max-heap or smallest child in a min-heap until the heap property is restored).

- Find min element: smallest key in heap

- Heapify: Convert an unsorted array into a heap. This can be done in O(n) time complexity using a bottom-up approach, ensuring the heap property is maintained throughout.

## Primitive Operations on Heaps

- Bubble up: swap value with its parent element if value is in wrong relation WITH ITS CHILDREN
- Bubble down: swap value with its smallest child element if value is in wrong relation WITH ITS PARENT

Python's heapq module provides functions to work with heaps and implements a min-heap by default.

## Examples of Heap Operations

### Pseudo-code for bubble up

    # Where A is the heap and j is the element out of place
def bubble_up(A, j):
    # Base case: j is already at the top of the heap
    if j <= 1:
        return
    else:
        # If the element at index j is out of place (less than its parent)
        if A[j] < A[j // 2]:
            swap(A[j], A[j // 2])
            # Call bubble_up on the next parent (since our original element is now at j // 2)
            bubble_up(A, j // 2)
        return

Worst-case time complexity: We call bubble up on a leaf node, and the number of calls is equal to the depth of the heap (O(log(n)))

### Pseudo-code for bubble down

def bubble_down(A, j):
    # (no children) j has no left child (out of bounds of array length n), so it certainly has no right child
    if A[2j] > n:
        return
    # Has left child but no right child
    if A[2j] <= n and A[2j + 1] > n:
        # If j is out of place with its left child
        if A[j] > A[2j]:
            swap(A[j], A[2j])
            bubble_down(A, A[2j])
    else:
    # j has two children, find out which is the smallest
        if A[2j] < A[2j + 1]
            smallest = A[2j]
        else:
            smallest = A[2j + 1]
        swap(A[j], smallest)
        bubble_down(A, smallest)

Worst-case time complexity: We call bubble down on the root of the heap and go to the depth of the heap (O(lob(n)))
