# Bloom Filters

- A bloom filter is a fast set data structure based on hashing
- Remember, a set stores unique values
- You can use Bloom Filters to check membership of an element... is x in the set?

Supports insert and check operations

- Approximate in nature; false positives possible

True -> may belong to set, but not guaranteed
False -> definitely does not belong to the set

Basic idea:

- You have k randomly chosen hash functions h
- The data structure itself is a bit string with m bits (1 or 0)

Insert element x: Set the bits h1(x), h2(x) ... hk(x) by computing a value of x with each hash function, giving you k different bit positions and setting them to 1. This is said to be that element's signature.

To check membership of element x, we ask if the bits h1(x), h2(x) ... hk(x) are all set to 1.

- Constant time insertion (O(K), the time it takes to calculate your k hash functions) and membership check

Membership query may return true even if the element was not inserted -- other members may have set those bits to true.

## Probability of false positive

In a table of k slots, with k hash functions called on n elements, the probability that any position is not set to 1 is (1 - (1/m)) ^kn, or e^-kn/m where m is the total number of bits in the hashtable

The probability that any given slot was set to 1 is (1-e^-kn/m), and the probability that ALL of the bits you're interested in are set to 1 is **(1-e^-kn/m)^k**, which is the probability of a false positive.

Example:

- n = 5,000 strings inserted into table
- m = 25,000 bit vector size (5 bits per element)
- k = 3 hash functions

Probability of false positive is about 0.09 or 9%

As m increases, the probability of a false positive decreases

## Applications of Bloom Filters

- Web content delivery and caching
    - Bloom filters help determine frequent requests to keep in the cache
    - Tells you if you have seen that same request frequently -- if so, keep it in cache, if not, eliminate it from cache to make space for something else
    - In this situation, the false positives are "okay" as you can reset the bloom filter and cache every now and then
