# Merge Sort

## Sorting algorithm that recursively splits an array into smaller subarrays and sorts subarrays, joining them into sorted result

Divide and conquer algorithm--problems divided into smaller subproblems recursively until subproblems become easy to solve, which are then combined to solve original problem

O(n * log(n)) time complexity

1. Split array in half
2. Call merge sort on each half to sort them recursively
3. Merge both sorted halves into one sorted array by comparing leftmost elements in subarrays

This works because an array with a single element is considered sorted, and each subsequent subarray that is joined together is SORTED (which allows us to compare leftmost elements)
