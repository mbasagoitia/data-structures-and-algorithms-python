# Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Shortest Paths

Given a directed graph with edge weights, determine single-source shortest paths from the given source.

This algorithm repeatedly performs the "edge relax" operation.

Output table: destination, source pi (parent columns) for each node. Each node's starting path cost is infinity.
