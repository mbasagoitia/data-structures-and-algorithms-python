# Selecting Hash Functions

## What Makes a Good Hash Function?

- Upon inserting any sequence of keys, a good hash function distributes these sequences across the table so that you have a good distribution and few collisions

Many languages and their runtimes implement their own hash functions for you

## Cryptographic hash functions

Complicated functions with small changes in input leading to large changes in the result of the hash, produces a hash code

## Designing Hash Functions

- Need to hash various types of keys beyond numbers
    - Lists/arrays
    - Tuples
    - Strings
    - Other user-defined objects

- Need to ensure that the hash function does not cause too many collisions
    - Add an element of randomness

- You can use cryptographic hash functions, but they sometimes tend to be overkill

## Hashing a List of Numbers

- Idea: add of the values of the list and take the modulo of the size of the list m (this will cause many collisions!)

Problems:
- Suppose keys are different permutations of the same list
- Suppose keys are obtained by adding/subtracting one from elements

- Better idea: Convert data to a number, or a sequence of 32/64 bit words
    - Choose a large prime number p (not a multiple of m) and multiply each subsequent word by p^0, p^1, p^2, etc., add them all up, and take modulo m. This takes into account the position of the word in the sequence of bits.

## Problems with Fixed (Known) Hash Functions

If someone has knowledge of the hash function, they can find keys that will always collide to the same slot

## Universal Hash Functions

Rather than fix a hash function, randomly choose a hash function from a family (large sets of hash functions) each time a new hashtable is instantiated

The complexity will depend upon the size of the linked list found at each index in the hash table

- For insert, delete, and find operations, the worst-case time complexity is O(n) (because all values could collide into the same ilnked list, and the entire list must be searched)

- Do not assume anything about the input, rather, focus on the hash function -- secretly choose a hash function from a family of hash functions, but do not tell the users which ones you are choosing

- Assuming m is the number of slots in the hashtable, and n is the number of elements being inserted, n/m represents the load factor.
    - Ideally, the load factor should be 1 or smaller

- Universal Property: Given any two (distinct) keys, the probability that they collide in a hashtable must be <= 1/m
    - A near-universal hash function (about 2/m), the average size of each list is 2 alpha (2 times the load factor); with true universal (1/m), the average size is simply alpha

- If hash functions are chosen well, the average-case complexity of insert, delete, and find methods are equal to the load factor (using a universal hash function)
