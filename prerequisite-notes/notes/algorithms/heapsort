# Heapsort

## Comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses the heap data structure and nvolves building a heap and then repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element.

## One solution (takes extra memory)

1. Heapify the array (max heap for descending order, min heap for ascending) and initilize result array
2. Repeatedly extract the max (or min) (delete it from the heap and add it to the result array)

## Sort in-place

Use the deleted portion to store the sorted array ("delete" minimum item and store it at the end, store item that was at the end at the beginning (swap them))
- This method will sort in the reverse order.

## Complexity

Heapify (O(n)) + delete operations(O(log(n))) = O(n(log(n)))
