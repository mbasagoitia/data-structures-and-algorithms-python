# Topological Sorting

Application of DFS

Given a directed, acyclic graph, sort it such that every edge goes from a lower rank vertext to a higher rank vertex. This ONLY works on directed, acyclic graphs. This is known as the topologically-sorted order.

- Nodes: tasks
- Edges: dependencies

Basic idea:

- Run a DFS on the graph
- Sort the nodes in descending order according to their finish times
- The two above steps can be combined into one step--as each node finishes, place it at the head of a list; this is the descending order

## Complexity

O(v + e) time complexity; we visit each vertex once and each edge once
