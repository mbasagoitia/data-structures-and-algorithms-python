# Graph Traversals

A graph traversal is an operation that starts from some point and visits nodes in some order, traversing only along edges.

- Each node can only be visted once, and some nodes may not be visited at all.
- Every node that you visit must be along an edge starting from an already-visited node.

## Breadth-First-Search: BFS

Uses a **queue** (FIFO data structure) to visit every node of the graph; record (dequeue) a node, enqueue its successors/adjacent nodes if they haven't been enqueued/discovered already, and continue.

Data to store in each node:
- pi: parent node (along which edge did I visit this node?)
- d: depth of the node (root has depth 0)
- visited: true/false

The queue defines the behavior of breadth-first search.

### Pseudo-code for BFS

    # Where u is the current node
def BFS(graph, u):
    # Declare a new queue
    q = new queue(u)
    # Starting node's depth is 0 (root)
    u.d = 0
    # Mark the node as visited
    u.visited = true
    # The root's parent is null
    u.pi = null

    # While there are still items in the queue,
    while(q):
        # Read/process the data in the head of the queue
        dequeue(u)
        # For all adjacent nodes v (an edge exists between them) of the current node u,
        for v in u:
            if !v.visited:
                v.depth = u.depth + 1
                v.pi = u
                v.visited = true
                enqueue(v)

BFS is also known as the "shortest path" algorithm because it allows you to find the shortest path between two nodes.

## Depth-First Search: DFS

DFS recursively visits successors of each node, backtracks, and continues.

Data to store in each node:
- pi: parent node
- d: discovery time
- f: finish time    
- visited: true/false

### Pseudo-code for DFS

def DFS(graph, u):
    global time
    
    u.visited = True
    time = time + 1
    u.d = time
    
    for v in u.neighbors:
        if not v.visited:
            v.pi = u
            DFS(graph, v)
    
    time = time + 1
    u.f = time


When BFS and DFS are finished running, they create a tree.

In some cases, not all elements are connected with the rest of the graph and a tree does not result from calling DFS or BFS. Instead, we get a "forest," or collection of trees.

What do we do when there are unconnected "islands" or nodes in a graph not reachable by the other nodes?

- Run an outer loop from i to n that calls dfs on every node, which will account for all nodes

### DFS Edge Classifications

- Tree edges: edges that are in the tree after running DFS
- Back edges: edges from a descendant to an ancestor
- Forward edges: edges from an ancestor to a descendant that is not a child; if it were a child, it would be a tree edge
- Cross edges: edges going between different trees in the forest or between nodes within the same tree that are neither descendants nor ancestors

We can determine the types of edges by analyzing their discovery/finish times.

This information can help us determine if a graph has a cycle.

### Cycles

A graph has a cycle if and only if DFS produces a back edge.

- Tree Edge: An edge (u, v) where v is discovered after u (i.e., v is a child of u in the DFS tree)

- Back Edge: An edge (u, v) where v is an ancestor of u in the DFS tree. This is detected if v is already discovered (d[v] is set) but not yet finished (f[v] is not set)

### Pseudocode to detect if a back edge is detected

def DFS(graph, u):
    global time
    global has_cycle

    u.visited = True
    time = time + 1
    u.d = time

    for v in u.neighbors:
        if not v.visited:
            v.pi = u
            DFS(graph, v)
        # Back edge detected (v is an ancestor and not yet finished)
        elif v.d < u.d and v.f is None:  
            # Indicate that a back edge (and thus a cycle) exists
            has_cycle = True  

    time = time + 1
    u.f = time  # Record the finish time
